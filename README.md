# NTPU Bubble Tea Map  
**Freshman General Education Course: Web Programming - Final Project**

### Project Overview
This project was developed as the final assignment for my freshman web programming course. The goal was to create a fully functional website, and I decided to design a **map of bubble tea shops** around National Taipei University. The website provides a comprehensive list of shops, along with a random drink suggestion feature to help users who can't decide what to order.

### Key Features

1. **Interactive Map**:  
   The website includes an interactive map that displays the locations of various bubble tea shops around the university campus. This map helps students quickly locate nearby shops.
   
2. **Random Drink Suggestion**:  
   For users who are indecisive about what to drink, I implemented a slot machine-style **random drink suggestion feature**. With just one click, the website suggests a random drink, adding an element of fun and surprise.

3. **Promotional Offers Section**:  
   The website integrates a section displaying current promotions or discounts from different shops. This helps students quickly check for any deals before heading out to purchase their bubble tea.

- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the website online.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions

1. **Lack of Experience**:  
   As a social work major, I had no prior experience in web development. I overcame this by doing extra research and practicing with various tutorials. Through this process, I developed a strong understanding of how to structure websites using HTML and CSS.

2. **Implementing Random Drink Selector**:  
   One of the most challenging parts was the random drink selection feature. Initially, I struggled with understanding how to implement JavaScript logic. I solved this by breaking the problem down into smaller tasks, creating a list of available drinks, and using basic randomization functions to pick a drink.

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:  
   Ensuring that the website worked smoothly across different browsers was another challenge. I tested the website on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and fixed issues related to styling and functionality for consistent user experience.

### Future Improvements

1. **Mobile Responsiveness**:  
   Currently, the website is primarily optimized for desktop use. In the future, I plan to make it fully responsive for mobile devices, ensuring that students can access it easily from their phones.

2. **More Interactive Features**:  
   I would like to add more interactive features, such as user reviews for each bubble tea shop or a “favorite shops” list that users can save for future reference.

3. **Real-Time Promotions**:  
   I hope to collaborate with local bubble tea shops to display real-time promotions on the site, allowing users to see the latest deals as they change.

4. **Multi-language Support**:  
   Currently, the website is in **Chinese only**, which limits accessibility for international students or tourists who may not speak the language. I plan to implement **multi-language support**, starting with an **English version**, and possibly expanding to other languages based on the user base. This could be achieved by using **language selection buttons** and integrating translation libraries or services like **i18next** or **Google Translate API** for dynamic content translation.
